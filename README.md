# zig-flecs

A semi-thin wrapper around the wonderful ecs [flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) for the [zig](https://ziglang.org) language.

Flecs version: 3.1.1

## Current Goals
- Provide the same functionality as using the flecs C macros using comptime.
- Provide matching zig examples for all C examples to ensure capability.
- Provide a higher level workflow that eases use for creating and using systems, queries, filters and observers.
